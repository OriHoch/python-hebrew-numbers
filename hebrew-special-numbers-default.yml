# About This File
#
# This style should contain data sufficient for the majority of cases where
# Hebrew numerals must be generated.
#
# For most cases, the typical algorithm using only the 'numerals' and possibly
# the 'separators' keys is sufficient. However, some special cases not following
# the typical algorithm exist. To cover these, the members of the 'specials' key
# are provided.
#
# If a different style is desired, modifications can be stored in a separate
# YAML file and deep-merged with the contents of this file. See
#
#   https://github.com/chaimleib/hebrew-special-numbers
#
# for example code.
